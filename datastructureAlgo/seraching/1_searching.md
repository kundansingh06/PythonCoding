# Linear Search vs Binary Search

Linear Search: input data need not to be in sorted.	
Binary Search: input data need to be in sorted order.

Linear Search: is also called sequential search.
Binary Search: is also called half-interval search.

The time complexity of linear search O(n). 	
The time complexity of binary search O(log n).

Linear Search: Multidimensional array can be used.
Binary Search: Only single dimensional array is used.

Linear Search: performs equality comparisons,less complex,very slow process.
Binary Search: performs ordering comparisons,more complex,very fast process.
