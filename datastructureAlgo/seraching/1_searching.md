# Linear Search vs Binary Search

* Linear Search: input data need not to be in sorted.	
* Binary Search: input data need to be in sorted order.


* Linear Search: is also called sequential search.
* Binary Search: is also called half-interval search.


* The time complexity of linear search O(n). 	
* The time complexity of binary search O(log n).


* Linear Search: Multidimensional array can be used.
* Binary Search: Only single dimensional array is used.


* Linear Search: performs equality comparisons,less complex,very slow process.
* Binary Search: performs ordering comparisons,more complex,very fast process.


Let us look at an example to compare two:

Linear serach to find element "J" in a given sorted list from A-X

Binary serach to find element "J" in a given sorted list from A-X
